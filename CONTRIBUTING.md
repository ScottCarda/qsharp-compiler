# Contributing to Q#

Welcome, and thank you for your interest in contributing to Q# and the Quantum Development Kit!

There are many ways in which you can contribute, beyond writing code. The goal of this document is to provide a high-level overview of how you can get involved.
For more details on how to contribute to Q# or the rest of the Quantum Development Kit, please see the [contribution guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/quantum/contributing/).

## Asking Questions

Have a question? The `q#` tags on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/q%23) and [Quantum Computing StackExchange](https://quantumcomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/q%23) are great places to ask questions about Q#, Quantum Development Kit and quantum computing in general.
You can learn more about our work on the [Q# Development Blog](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/qsharp/) and ask questions in the comments as well.
Wherever you ask it, your well-worded question will serve as a resource to others searching for help.

## Reporting Issues

Have you identified a reproducible problem in the Quantum Development Kit?
Have a feature request?
We want to hear about it!
Here's how you can make reporting your issue as effective as possible.

### Identify Where to Report

The Quantum Development Kit is distributed across multiple repositories. Try to file the issue against the correct repository.
Check the list [in the contribution guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/quantum/contributing/#where-do-contributions-go) if you aren't sure which repo is correct.

### Writing Good Bug Reports and Feature Requests

File a single issue per problem and feature request.
Do not enumerate multiple bugs or feature requests in the same issue.

The more information you can provide, the more likely someone will be successful at reproducing the issue and finding a fix.

Please include the following with each issue:

* Version of the NuGet package or extension for which the problem occurs

* Your operating system and .NET Core version  

* For issues with extensions, the version of the IDE for which the problem occurs 

* Reproducible steps (1... 2... 3...) that cause the issue

* What you expected to happen, versus what actually happened

## Contributing Documentation

If you are interested in contributing to conceptual documentation about Q#, please see the [MicrosoftDocs/quantum-docs-pr](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/quantum-docs-pr) repository.
If you are interested in contributing API references, please see [Contributing Code](https://docs.microsoft.com/quantum/contributing/code) in the contribution guide.

## Contributing Code

If you are interested in helping fix issues you or someone else encountered, 
please make sure that the corresponding issue has been filed on the repository. 
Check that nobody is currently working on it and that it has indeed been marked as bug. 
If that's the case, indicate on the issue that you are working on it, 
and link to the corresponding GitHub page where the fix is being developed. 
If someone is already working on a fix, ask if you can help or see what other things can be done.
If an issue is tagged as feature, please follow the guidelines related to contributing features. 
Sometimes it may take a couple of days for us to tag issues appropriately. 
If an issue has not been tagged yet, please indicate that you would like to work on it and be patient - 
we are a small team and are doing our best to be quick with responding to your inquiry!

If you are interested in contributing a new feature, 
please first check if a similar functionality has already been requested. 
If so, consider contributing to the discussion around it rather than filing a separate issue.
If no open or closed issue with such a request already exists, 
please file one following the feature request template. 
We will respond to feature requests and follow up with a discussion around its feasibility, 
how one might go about implementing it, and whether that is something we would consider adding to our repo. 
There are several reasons why we might not be able to eventually merge even a great feature for one reason or another. 
Take a look at our general contribution guide for [reasons why this might be the case](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/quantum/contributing/code?view=qsharp-preview#when-well-reject-a-pull-request). 
Even if we are not able to incorporate something into the packages and extensions we distribute, 
we encourage you to pursue your passion project in your own fork, 
and share and discuss your thoughts and progress on the corresponding issue. 

If you are looking for a place to get started with contributing code, 
search for example for the good-first-issue or help-wanted tags. 
Also look for issues that have already been discussed in more detail, 
and check if you can help someone who has already started working on it. 

Whether you want to help fixing bugs or add new features, please take a look at our general guide for [Contributing Code](https://docs.microsoft.com/quantum/contributing/code).

And last but not least:

# Thank You!

Your contributions to open source, large or small, make great projects like this possible.
Thank you for taking the time to contribute.
